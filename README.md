# Project-OH-NO

*Project: OH-NO is a wholesale Java reproduction of the popular card game UNO. It will feature a full Graphical User Interface, standard and random deck options, as well as both Player vs. Player and Player vs. AI options. It will allow for an unlimited number of players (minimum 3) to play against each other on one computer.*

To do:

* Implement functioning text interface
* Methods for each class
* "shuffleDeck" method in Board class
* Finalize code structure

Ideas:

* Interface for hardening UNO rules?
* Dedicated class for game rules?
